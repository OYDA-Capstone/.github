# OYDA Interface

The OYDA Interface is a comprehensive solution designed to enable independent collaborative development. The first step towards this goal is the introduction of the `oydadb` package, a powerful tool that simplifies interactions with PostgreSQL databases in Flutter applications. It encapsulates all necessary database operations within the `OYDAInterface` class, making it easier to perform CRUD operations.
